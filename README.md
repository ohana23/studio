## Etsy API

Some features search Etsy for product listings. To enable this functionality,
create a `.env` file with your Etsy API key:

```bash
ETSY_API_KEY=your-api-key
```

To try the Etsy feature without an API key, you can enable mock mode by setting
the following flag in your `.env` file:

```bash
USE_MOCK_ETSY=true
```
